    """
    Controller exposed to plugin consumers to interact with the editor.
    Provides a clean, Pythonic API for executing rich text commands.

    IMPORTANT USAGE NOTE ON `setState()`:
    This controller manages two types of operations:
    
    1. Direct UI Commands (e.g., `bold()`, `set_font_color()`): These commands
       are sent to the browser, which updates the UI immediately. The browser
       then notifies Python of the change via its `onChange` event. You
       **MUST NOT** call `setState()` in your application after calling these
       methods, as it will cause a race condition and unexpected behavior.

    2. State-Modifying Commands (e.g., `load_from_markdown()`): These methods
       change the editor's content from the Python side. They handle their
       own internal state updates and will trigger a rebuild when `setState()`
        is called. You **SHOULD** call `setState()` after these methods.
