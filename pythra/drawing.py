PyThra Drawing System - Create Custom Shapes and Graphics

This is PyThra's "digital art studio" for creating custom shapes, lines, curves,
and complex graphics that go beyond simple rectangles and circles. Think of it
as having a professional drawing tool built right into your UI framework.

**What can you create?**
- Custom icons and symbols
- Complex geometric shapes
- Smooth curves and organic forms  
- Interactive diagrams and charts
- Custom button shapes and decorations
- Logos and branding elements

**Real-world analogy:**
Like using Adobe Illustrator or drawing with a vector graphics program:
- You give precise instructions ("move here", "draw line to there", "curve this way")
- The computer follows those instructions to create smooth, scalable graphics
- You can combine simple commands to create complex artwork

**How it works:**
1. **Path Commands**: Individual drawing instructions (MoveTo, LineTo, etc.)
2. **SVG Output**: Commands get converted to web-standard SVG graphics
3. **Widget Integration**: Your custom shapes become regular PyThra widgets
4. **Scalability**: Graphics scale perfectly at any size (vector-based)

**Key drawing concepts:**
- **Path**: A series of connected points and curves forming a shape
- **Commands**: Individual instructions like "move to point X,Y" or "draw line to X,Y"
- **Current Position**: The "pen location" that moves as you draw
- **SVG**: The web standard for scalable vector graphics

class PathCommandWidget(Widget):
    """
    The base class for all drawing commands - like individual "drawing instructions".
    
    **What is a PathCommandWidget?**
    Think of this like a single instruction you'd give to an artist:
    - "Move your pencil to point (10, 20)"
    - "Draw a straight line to point (50, 60)"
    - "Draw a curved line through these control points"
    
    **Real-world analogy:**
    Like dance choreography instructions:
    - Each PathCommandWidget is one move in the dance
    - Combine many moves to create a complete dance routine
    - The "dancer" (SVG renderer) follows each instruction in sequence
    
    **All drawing commands inherit from this and implement:**
    - to_svg_command(): Converts the instruction to SVG format
    
    **You typically don't use this directly** - instead use the specific
    command types like MoveTo, LineTo, ArcTo, etc.

# BASIC DRAWING COMMANDS - The "Fundamental Drawing Moves"
# =============================================================================

class MoveTo(PathCommandWidget):
    """
    The "lift pen and move" command - moves to a point without drawing a line.
    
    **What does MoveTo do?**
    Like lifting your pen off paper and moving it to a new starting position.
    This is usually the first command in any drawing - it sets where you begin.
    
    **Real-world analogy:**
    - Like moving your finger to a new position on a touch screen before drawing
    - Like lifting a pencil and placing it at a new spot on paper
    - Like telling someone "start drawing from this corner of the page"
    
    **When to use MoveTo:**
    - Beginning a new shape or line
    - Creating disconnected shapes in the same path
    - Moving to start a new part of a complex drawing
    
    **Example:**
    ```python
    # Start drawing a triangle at point (10, 10)
    MoveTo(10, 10),  # "Lift pen, move to top corner"
    LineTo(50, 50),  # "Draw line to bottom right"
    LineTo(10, 50),  # "Draw line to bottom left"  
    ClosePath()      # "Draw line back to start (close triangle)"
    ```
    
    Args:
        x: The X coordinate to move to
        y: The Y coordinate to move to

        """Converts to SVG 'M' command and updates the current pen position."""
        current_pos['x'], current_pos['y'] = self.x, self.y
        return f"M {self.x} {self.y}"

class LineTo(PathCommandWidget):
    """
    The "draw a straight line" command - draws from current position to a new point.
    
    **What does LineTo do?**
    Draws a perfectly straight line from wherever the "pen" currently is to the
    new coordinates you specify. This is the most basic drawing command.
    
    **Real-world analogy:**
    - Like drawing a straight line with a ruler
    - Like connecting two dots with the shortest path
    - Like telling someone "from where you are now, draw straight to this point"
    
    **When to use LineTo:**
    - Creating straight edges of shapes (rectangles, triangles, polygons)
    - Drawing geometric patterns and grids
    - Creating angular/sharp designs
    - Building the outline of any shape with straight sides
    
    **Example:**
    ```python
    # Draw a simple house outline
    MoveTo(100, 200),   # Start at bottom left corner
    LineTo(200, 200),   # Draw bottom edge (roof base)
    LineTo(200, 100),   # Draw right wall up
    LineTo(150, 50),    # Draw right roof edge
    LineTo(100, 100),   # Draw left roof edge  
    ClosePath()         # Draw left wall down to start

class ClosePath(PathCommandWidget):
    """
    The "connect back to start" command - draws a line back to where you started.
    
    **What does ClosePath do?**
    Automatically draws a straight line from the current position back to wherever
    your path started (the last MoveTo point). This "closes" your shape.
    
    **Real-world analogy:**
    - Like completing a circle by connecting the end back to the beginning
    - Like closing a fence by connecting the last post to the first
    - Like telling someone "now draw back to where you started"
    
    **When to use ClosePath:**
    - Finishing any closed shape (triangles, rectangles, polygons, etc.)
    - Creating filled shapes that need to be completely enclosed
    - Ensuring no gaps in your shape outline
    
    **Why is this useful?**
    Without ClosePath, your shape would have a small gap between the end and start.
    ClosePath ensures perfect closure and is required for filled shapes.
    
    **Example:**
    ```python
    # Draw a triangle that's properly closed
    MoveTo(50, 20),     # Start at top point
    LineTo(20, 80),     # Draw to bottom left
    LineTo(80, 80),     # Draw to bottom right
    ClosePath()         # Automatically draw back to top point
    # Result: Perfect triangle with no gaps
    ```
    
    **Note:** ClosePath takes no coordinates - it automatically knows where to go!
